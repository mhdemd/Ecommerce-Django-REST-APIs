        # Logs out a user by blacklisting the refresh token.

        - To use this endpoint, you first need to authorize yourself from the top of the Swagger UI page.

        - By sending the refresh token, it is added to the blacklist and becomes invalid.

        - The access token remains valid in this case (although it will eventually expire automatically).

        - The serializer includes built-in validations to prevent XSS attacks, ensuring no field is vulnerable.

        - Email and password fields are validated according to Django standards to guarantee proper formatting.

        - Rate limiting is implemented to prevent excessive requests, with customizable limits for added security.

        - The user model includes 'verification_token' and 'token_expiration' fields to secure the email verification link.

        - Once the link is used for verification, the token is cleared to maintain security.
